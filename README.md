<h1>8-Puzzle Problem</h1>
<h2>Implements the A* search algorithm to find an optimal solution with the minimum path cost.</h2>
<p>A* search algorithm:<br>
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)<br>
where f(n) is the total path cost,<br>
and g(n) is the total step cost function the calculates the cost of going from the root state to the current state,<br>
and h(n) is the heuristic function that approximates the cost to reach the goal state</p>
