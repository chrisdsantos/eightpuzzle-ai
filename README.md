<h1>8-Puzzle Problem</h1>
<h2>Implements A* search algorithm to find an optimal solution with the minimum path cost.</h2>
<p>A* search algorithm:
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
where g(n) is the total path cost from the root state to the current state
where h(n) is the approximate cost to reach the goal state</p>
